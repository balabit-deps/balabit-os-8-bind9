bind9 (1:9.16.0-1ubuntu1) focal; urgency=medium

  Some packages like isc-dhcp do not build with bind 9.14 or higher, so a new
  source package bind9-libs version 9.11 was created for that purpose,
  providing only libraries and header files. The bind9 9.16.x packages do not
  provide development libraries or headers. See commit
  https://salsa.debian.org/dns-team/bind9-libs/commit/40cab7029d for more
  details. udebs used in the debian-installer are also being provided by
  bind9-libs.

  Another package which doesn't build with the newer bind9 package is
  bind-dyndb-ldap. It will build using the libraries from bind9-libs, but
  since this is a server plugin, it won't work with the newer server.

  Native pkcs#11 support via softhsm2 is no longer being built for this
  package. This was first introduced in 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-8 (see
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1565392) for FreeIPA. Ubuntu Focal no longer
  ships FreeIPA, and Debian also dropped the native pkcs#11 support.

  There are no development libraries or header files in this bind9 9.16.x
  packaging at the moment. This may change later, see
